The purpose of this study is to identify all visible structures located either partially or completely within the effective and revised floodplain for DeKalb County. This study is intended to identify flood prone buildings and roadways; estimate flooding depths for structures and roadways at the 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, 100-, and 500-year flood events (effective and revised); determine severity of flooding on structures; and develop a danger classification ranking system for structures and roadways.
