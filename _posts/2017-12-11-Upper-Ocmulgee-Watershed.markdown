The Upper Ocmulgee Watershed Flood Risk Map displays base data reflecting community boundaries, major roads, and stream lines; potential losses that include both the 2010 Flood Average Annualized Loss (AAL) Study supplemented with new Hazus runs for areas with new or updated flood modeling; new Flood Risk Project areas; a bar chart summarizing community per capita loss; and graphics and text that promote access and usage of additional data available through the FRD, FIRM, and National Flood Hazard Layer and viewers (desktop or FEMA website, etc.). This information can be used to assist in Flood Risk Project-level planning as well as for developing mitigation actions within each jurisdiction located within the Flood Risk Project.
